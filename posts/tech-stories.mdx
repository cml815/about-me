# Start-up Stories

Picture when you've shared a defining moment in your life to someone. Think back on that time. You might say where it happened and how you felt. 

Such a moment for me was when I decided to go freelance. I was in DC for a job interview where the peer interviewers said the job was a "stepping stone." I remembered their resigned expressions when my recruiter called. 

"How was the interview?"
"It's not a good fit," I said
"I'll find you something else"

"Sorry, I don't want this. I'm going freelance."
